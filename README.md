## 📖 Overview
The design of informative input signals is crucial for accurate system identification.  
Traditional Fisher-information–based approaches are inherently local and may fail under large parameter uncertainty or nonlinear dynamics.  
This project implements a **Bayesian input design framework** based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) between model parameters and observations, using a **tractable lower bound**.
